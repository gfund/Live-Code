# Live Code 
The script in main.py allows you to write a code into a file name script then your language extension and then if the script is updated, your code will be run which makes restarting the code unneccessary which makes development easier. This only works with synchronous code currently.

**Note: This has not been thorougly tested though conceptually it will work.**

I am yet to add more language associations into the association array on line 17. Feel free to modify this if you want to use another language. **Only lowercase!**
